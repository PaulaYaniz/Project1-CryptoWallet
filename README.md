# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

### Design statement:
I will design and make a digital ledger for a client who is a trader. The digital ledger will consist on a tool for being able to keep track of cryptocurrencies investments, transactions and to know some statistics, and is constructed using the software Python. It will take 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria ???.

### Justify the tools/structure of your solution
I have chosed Python for my program because...

In my program code there are comments explaining each part of it and the variables have understandable names.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. 
5. The user will only be able to see the data in the program after entering a password.
6. It will give value in two different currencies: EUR (Euros) and JPY (Yen).
7. ¿The program will show graphs about ...?
8. ¿The program will show data of the crypto in multiple dates ??? <-- hard to do

# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

## Flow Diagrams
